# DOM Manipulation Project

This project demonstrates how to create a dynamic webpage that manipulates the DOM (Document Object Model) to generate a navigation bar, scroll to sections smoothly, and highlight the active section.

## Project Overview

- **HTML**: The structure of the webpage consists of multiple sections that the user can navigate through. Each section is represented by a `section` tag and contains a heading and some text.
- **CSS**: The styling for the webpage ensures that the layout is responsive. It uses flexbox for the navigation bar and includes animations for section transitions and active states.
- **JavaScript**: The script manipulates the DOM by dynamically generating a navigation menu based on the sections. It also listens for scrolling events to highlight the active section in the viewport and ensures smooth scrolling when the user clicks on a navigation link.

## Features

- **Dynamic Navigation Menu**: The navigation menu is created dynamically based on the sections present on the page. Each section has a corresponding link in the navigation bar.
- **Active Section Highlighting**: When the user scrolls through the page, the current section in view is highlighted both in the navigation bar and within the section itself.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: When a user clicks on a navigation link, the page smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section.
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage is designed to be fully responsive, with a hamburger-style menu for smaller screen sizes (less than 768px).
